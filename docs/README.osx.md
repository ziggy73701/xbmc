## 1 Introduction

This is a platform port of Kodi for the Apple macOS operating system.
Starting with Kodi v18 the build system has been migrated from native Xcode to
CMake (and generated project files).

There are 3 ways to build Kodi for Mac:

- Xcode IDE (easiest as it presents the build system in a GUI environment)
- command-line with xcodebuild
- command-line with make

Kodi for Mac is composed of a main binary with numerous dynamic libraries and
codecs that support a multitude of music and video formats.

The minimum version of OSX you need to run(!) Kodi is 10.8 atm.

- On El Capitan (OSX 10.11.x) we recommend using Xcode 8.x.
- On Sierra (macOS 10.12.x) we recommend using Xcode 8.x.
- On High Sierra (macOS 10.13.x) we recommend using Xcode 9.x.

## 2 Getting the source code

    cd $HOME
    git clone git://github.com/xbmc/xbmc.git Kodi

## 3 Install build dependencies

### 3.1 Install Xcode

Install the Xcode version recommended for your macOS version. You can download
it either from the macOS AppStore (Xcode) or from the Apple Developer Homepage.

As far as we know the compilation for macOS should work with the following
constellations of Xcode and macOS versions (to be updated once we know more):

7 Xcode 8.0 against OSX SDK 10.12 (EC)
8 Xcode 8.0 against OSX SDK 10.12 (S)
9 Xcode 9.0 against OSX SDK 10.13 (HS)

### 3.2 Install Kodi build depends

Kodi requires a set of build dependencies to be built and installed before you
will be able to build the Kodi main binary. These often just called *depends*
are installed using the commands described below (with the latest macOS SDK
found on your system).

In order to speedup compilation it is recommended to use `make -j$(getconf
_NPROCESSORS_ONLN)` instead of `make` to compile on all available processor
cores. The build machine can also be configured to do this automatically by
adding `export MAKEFLAGS="-j(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)"` to your shell config
(e.g. `~/.bashrc`).

#### 3.2.a Compiling as 64 bit libraries (recommended for most users)

    cd $HOME/Kodi
    cd tools/depends
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --host=x86_64-apple-darwin
    make

#### 3.2.b Compiling as 32 bit libraries

    cd $HOME/Kodi
    cd tools/depends
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --host=i386-apple-darwin
    make

#### 3.3.c Advanced topics

The dependencies are built into `tools/depends` and installed into
`/Users/Shared/xbmc-depends`.

**ADVANCED developers only**: If you want to specify an macOS SDK version (if
multiple versions are installed) - then append it to the configure line
above. The example below would use the macOS SDK 10.9:

    ./configure --host=arm-apple-darwin --with-sdk=10.9

### 3.3 Compile Kodi binary addons

Kodi maintains a set of binary addons (PVR clients, Visualizations
plugins and more). They can be built as shown below:

    cd $HOME/Kodi
    cd tools/depends
    make -C target/binary-addons

**NOTE**: If you only want to build specific addons you can specify like this:

    cd $HOME/Kodi
    cd tools/depends
    make -C target/binary-addons ADDONS="pvr.hts pvr.dvblink"

## 4 How to compile Kodi

### 4.1 Using Xcode (or xcodebuild)

#### 4.1.1 Generate CMake project files

Before you can use Xcode to build Kodi, the Xcode project has to be generated
with CMake. Note that CMake is compiled as parts of the depends doesn't have
to be installed separately. Also a Toolchain-file has been generated with is
used to configure CMake.

    mkdir $HOME/Kodi/build
    cd $HOME/Kodi/build
    /Users/Shared/xbmc-depends/x86_64-darwin15.6.0-native/bin/cmake -G Xcode -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/Users/Shared/xbmc-depends/macosx10.12_x86_64-target/share/Toolchain.cmake ..

The toolchain file location differs depending on your macOS and SDK version and
you have to replace `x86_64-darwin15.6.0-native` and `macosx10.12_x86_64` in the filename above with the correct
file on your system. Check the directory content to get the filename.

#### 4.1.2 Compilation using Xcode

Start Xcode and open the Kodi project (kodi.xcodeproj) located in
`$HOME/Kodi/build`.

If you have selected a specific OSX SDK Version in step 3.2 then you might need
to adapt the active target to use the same OSX SDK version. Else build will fail.

The build process will take a long time when building the first time.
You can see the progress in "Build Results". There are a large number of static
and dynamic libraries that will need to be built. Once these are built,
subsequent builds will be faster.

After the build, you can ether run Kodi for Mac from Xcode or run it from
the command-line. If you run it from the command-line:

    $HOME/Kodi/build/Debug/kodi.bin

Or the release version:

    $HOME/Kodi/build/Release/kodi.bin

Alternatively, you can also build via Xcode from the command-line with
xcodebuild, triggered by CMake:

    cd $HOME/Kodi/build
    cmake --build . --config "Debug" -- -verbose -jobs $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)

You can specify `Release` instead of `Debug` as a configuration.

### 4.2 Compilation using command-line (make)

CMake is also able to generate a Makefile based project that can be used to
compile with make:

    cd $HOME/Kodi
    make -C tools/depends/target/cmakebuildsys
    make -C build

## 5 Packaging

CMake generate a target called `dmg` which will package Kodi.app for
distribution.

After Kodi has been build, the target ca be triggered with by selecting it in
Xcode, or if using makefiles by issuing:

    make dmg
